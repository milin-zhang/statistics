# Regression

## Introduction to regression

Regression is one step further from correlation where we predict the outcome (DV) from one or more variables (IV). Depending on the number of IV, there are simple regression and multiple regression.

-   Method of least square

The goal of finding a suitable regression model is usually achieved by finding the least square, namely the smallest residuals (deviations, difference between the real data and the model) from all the possible model out there.

-   Goodness of fit

1. Sum of squares

SST: total sum of squares, i.e., total amount of differences between the most basic model, mean, from the real data

SSR: residual sum of squares, i.e., total amount of differences between the chosen model, e.g., the best-fitting regression model, and the real data.

SSM: model sum of square, the difference between SST and SSR, which is the reduced difference after applying the model.

2. R square

R Square = SSM / SST

which represents the variance in the outcome explained by the model (SSM) compared to the variance that is there to be explained in the first place (SST).

The square root of this value is the Pearson's coefficient.

3. F-test

In its general form, F-test statistics represent the amount of systematic variance divided by the amount of unsystematic variance, or to put it differently, the model against the error. In the case of regression, the F statistics is the improvement due to model (SSM) divided by the difference between model and the observed data (SSR).

F = MSM / MSR

MSM = Model mean square = SSM / the number of vars in the model

MSR = Residual mean square = SSR / the number of observation - the number of parameters being estimated. (further explained in ANOVA GLM1)

## Example studies

### Example study I (Leung and Lee, 2014)

-   Objective

Study the consumption of online alternative media, mainly the drives (predictors) and consequences (impacts) of such consumption.

-   RQ and hypothesis

    -   Hypothesis 1: *Support for democratization* relates positively to Internet alternative media usage.

    -   Hypothesis 2: *Perception of media self-censorship* relates positively to Internet alternative media usage.

    -   Hypothesis 3: *News acquisition via Facebook* relates positively to Internet alternative media usage.

    -   Hypothesis 4: The relationship stipulated in Hypothesis 3 is stronger among *supporters of democratization*.

    -   Hypothesis 5: The relationship stipulated in Hypothesis 3 is stronger among people who *perceive media self-censorship as serious*.

    -   Hypothesis 6: Internet alternative media usage relates positively to *protest participation*.

    -   Hypothesis 7: Internet alternative media usage relates positively to *support for the planned civil disobedience campaign for universal suffrage*.

    -   Hypothesis 8: The relationships stipulated in Hypotheses 6 and 7 are stronger among *supporters of democratization*.

The selection of the variables is based on hypotheses, which were traced essentially back to theories.

-   Method

Data: survey data

Analysis:

2 hierarchichal regression models targeting different sets of hypos (predictors + impacts).

"The regression model contains all the **controls**, the **main effect variables** for Hypotheses 1 to 3 (i.e., support for democratization, perceived media self-censorship, and news acquisition via social media), and **two interaction terms** for testing Hypotheses 4 and 5 (News acquisition via social media × Support for democratization, and News acquisition via social media × Perceived self-censorship). The interaction terms were centered by means to reduce multicollinearity." (Leung and Lee, 2014, p. 349)

"We can now turn to the impact of Internet alternative media usage on protest participation and attitude toward civil disobedience as suggested in Hypotheses 6 to 8. Two hierarchical regression analyses were conducted for the purpose. The independent variables are largely the same as those in Table 1. The only exceptions are the omission of perceived media self-censorship (which is not central to explain protest participation) and that the interaction between news acquisition via social media and perceived media self-censorship is replaced by Internet alternative media usage × Support for democratization, the interaction term central to Hypothesis 8. The interaction between news acquisition via social media and support for democratization is retained for illustrative purposes." (Leung and Lee, 2014, p. 351)

note for further study

-   interaction term as a variable in the regression model, how?

-   why do you need to center the terms by means to reduce multicollinearity?

-   classic imputation strategies for missing values ("missing values were replaced by means")

-   how to interpret R2 and the triangle R2?
