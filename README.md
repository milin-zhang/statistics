At some point i realized with statistics, one never truly learns until one organizes all the concepts and equations together in their own way and not just read them on papers.  

This is the place where i store my notes on statistics / mathematics for social sciences for myself from different books and scientific papers. It perhaps will be adapted to tutorials in the future.
