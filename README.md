This is the place where i store my notes on statistics / mathematics for social sciences for myself and perhaps will be adapted to tutorials in the future.

*This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: <https://github.com/jtr13/bookdown-template>.*

### notes for rendering the book (RStudio)

1.  Install **bookdown** with `install.packages("bookdown")`. If you already have it, update to the most recent version.

2.  Render locally with `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")` or clicking the *Build book* button which should appear in the Build tab (in the same pane as Environment, History, Connections, ...).

3.  Use `browseURL("docs/index.html")` to view your book locally (or just open `index.html` in a browser).

4.  If it looks good, commit and push all changed files to GitHub.

5.  Open the Github Repo link: `usethis::browse_github()`
