At some point i realized with statistics, one never truly learn until one organizes all the concepts and equations together in their own way and not just read them on papers.
This is the place where i store my notes on statistics / mathematics for social sciences for myself from different books and scientific papers. It perhaps will be adapted to tutorials in the future.

### notes for rendering the book (RStudio)

1.  Install **bookdown** with `install.packages("bookdown")`. If you already have it, update to the most recent version.

2.  Render locally with `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")` or clicking the *Build book* button which should appear in the Build tab (in the same pane as Environment, History, Connections, ...).

3.  Use `browseURL("docs/index.html")` to view your book locally (or just open `index.html` in a browser).

4.  If it looks good, commit and push all changed files to GitHub.

5.  Open the Github Repo link: `usethis::browse_github()`
