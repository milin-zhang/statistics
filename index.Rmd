# Introduction

Goal of this site:

-   organize my own statistical notes mainly focusing on application for social science

-   note down new statistical concepts when reading research papers and how they can contribute to my research

    -   which highly relies on regression analysis and longitudinal data analysis to test hypothesis

The notes taken on this site are rarely my own content, i mainly take notes from following sources:

-   MA course "Multivariate Statistics" handouts by Maud Reveilhac: <https://meth.ikmz.uzh.ch/>

-   Textbooks series of "Discovering Statistics" by Andy Field: <https://discoveringstatistics.com/>

-   Statistics Tutorial by numiqo: <https://numiqo.com/tutorial/get-started>
