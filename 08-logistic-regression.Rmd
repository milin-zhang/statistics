# Logistic regression

## Example studies

### Example study 1 (Müller & Bach, 2021)

"Preliminary analyses revealed that there is an excess number of cases with zero exposure to alternative news in both data sets. To account for this skewed distribution of our criterion variable, we opted to use hurdle models (see Mullahy, 1986) to analyze predictors of alternative news use. " (Müller & Bach, 2021)

what is a hurdle model? -> particularly useful for data with many zero values
